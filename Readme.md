# Requirements

You need to install globally: coffee and gulp:
```
$ npm install -g coffee-script gulp
```


# Install

Run:
```
$ npm install
```

Then launch the server and the app with:
```
$ gulp
```

The app should automatically open in a browser. If it is not the case, open `localhost:3000` in a Web browser.
